The directories above contain some fun electronics projects for kids (or anyone that wants to do some electronic stuff).

# How to get stuff

- I've ordered PCBs from [oshpark.com](https://oshpark.com/).
- I've ordered parts (everything that goes on the board) from [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/)
- Projects include a `bom.txt` file which you can upload to Mouser when ordering parts.
- If you need a soldering iron, this one looks like a really good deal: [https://amzn.com/B06XZ31W3M](https://amzn.com/B06XZ31W3M)
