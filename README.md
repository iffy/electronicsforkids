Here are some fun electronics projects for kids.

# How to get stuff

- I've ordered PCBs from [oshpark.com](https://oshpark.com/).
- I've ordered parts (everything that goes on the board) from [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/)
- Projects include a `bom.txt` file which you can upload to Mouser when ordering parts.
